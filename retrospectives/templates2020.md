Delivering clarity, purpose, expectations

Agile Mindset 

    (4/12) Agile Principles
      Working software is the primary measure of progress.

      Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

      Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

      Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.


Measure of progress, expectations on performance from Agile and Scrum perspective.
Lean Performance Metrics
  Lead time: Lead time is the time it takes to go from a customer making a request to the request being satisfied. The elevation of lead time as a metric is a key element of the Lean theory.

  Deployment frequency: How often does an organisation deploy code to production or release it to end users.

 
Actions, habits and practices should be focused on support & improve organisational performance.
Many feedback from previous retros can be mapped as improvements needed in these areas.

  ## Look Back - 30'
  In this part we:

    Follow up on actions and insights from previous sprints

    Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.

    Identify and order the major items that went well.

    Insights collected on previous retros and actions will not be left behind.
    
  ## Look Forward - 45'
  The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do.

In this part we:

  - Identify and order potential improvements.

  - Create a plan for implementing improvements.

A SMART goal is used to help guide goal setting. SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Therefore, a SMART goal incorporates all of these criteria to help focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal.

 
  * How to write Actions
    
    Actions usually have:

    - An Intention: the idea that you plan (or intend) to carry out.

    - A Target: the key target outcomes towards the intention.

    - Successful condition (if) : the indicator(s) that prove(s) the criteria is being met.

Echoing goals properties the actions we would like to implement should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic have a due date and assignee.

  * How to write Habits

  To build a new habit we need to p:

  - When this happens...

    - Trigger(s) e.g. person, action, feeling or situation.

  - Instead of...

    - Old habit we want to stop doing.

  - I (we) will...

    - New habit we want to start.

Although the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation, improvements may be implemented at any time.

Delivering clarity, purpose, expectations

”Planning Is Everything. The Plan Is Nothing” - Dwight Eisenhower

  - Importance of planning, roadmap, estimations, commitments, due dates.

  - Performance: Lead time, Deployment frequency.

  - Due dates are not the end of the project but the start of revenue.

“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face“ - Mike Tyson


* Agile Principles (4/12)

  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

  - Build projects around motivated individuals.Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.


* Reacting to changes

  - As team we accept and welcome changes and we need to demand clarity, descriptions, value, requirements, ACs around requested changes.

  - If team members have capacity they should take next top priority item from PBL. This means the PBL should have item ready and estimates enough for 1.5-2 sprints ahead. We all need to contribute to make this happen.
