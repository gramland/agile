# Story Points


Scrum does not define techniques for expressing or prioritizing items in the Product Backlog and
it does not define an estimation technique. A common technique is to estimate in terms of
relative size (factoring in effort, complexity, and uncertainty) using a unit of “story points” or
simply “points”.
