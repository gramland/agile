# Story Points


> We don’t have to agree with every idea in a book, article, talk, or podcast to recommend it. 
Sometimes the perspectives that challenge our thinking are the ones that teach us the most. 
The point of learning is not to affirm our beliefs. It's to evolve our beliefs.

Scrum does not define any estimation technique. ( [ScrumPapers](http://jeffsutherland.org/scrum/ScrumPapers.pdf) )
This creates tons of opinionated articles around Story Points, velocity, estimations....
It’s up to the Scrum Team to agree upon what’s the best way to estimate and if/how to use SP (definition, meaning, limits, praxis…)
Here few links to challenge our beliefs.
